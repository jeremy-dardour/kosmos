# Current State

The single live snapshot of where the project is. Overwrite this as things
change — it always reflects _now_. For the history of how we got here, see
[docs/sessions/](./sessions/); for the full behavioral spec and rationale, see
the [V1 Product PRD](./specs/v1-product/PRD.md).

## Phase

**Ready to build.** All planning complete. V1 is fully specified — domain model,
schema, API contract, state machine implementation, auth, deployment, UI slices.
10 GitHub issues created as end-to-end build slices. No open design questions.

## Done

- Domain model defined and agreed — entities, statuses, and rules in
  [CONTEXT.md](../CONTEXT.md); full behavioral spec with rationale in the
  [V1 Product PRD](./specs/v1-product/PRD.md).
- UI direction chosen: the two-panel "Pipeline Stack" wireframe
  ([docs/prototype/timeline/](./prototype/timeline/), turn 3 / option 3a).
- Specified the Workstream **pipeline state machine** end-to-end
  ([ADR 0005](./adr/0005-workstream-pipeline-state-machine.md)).
- Entity/schema design written
  ([entity-schema-design.md](./entity-schema-design.md)).
- Auth approach resolved: GIS + `.env` allow-list, consent screen "In
  production" with non-sensitive scopes.
  ([docs/specs/auth/PRD.md](./specs/auth/PRD.md)).
- API contract resolved: unified `advance` endpoint, one overview aggregate
  read, flat CRUD, derived state server-side.
  ([docs/specs/api-contract/PRD.md](./specs/api-contract/PRD.md)).
- Hosting & deployment resolved: Cloud Run + Neon, single deployable, ~$0/mo.
- Overview UI build slices defined: 7 ordered increments.
- State machine implementation decisions resolved: unified `advance` API,
  private methods on `WorkstreamService`, explicit transactions for advance +
  reorder only, pure utility functions for derived state.
  (see [V1 Tech Design § State machine](./specs/v1-tech-design.md)).
- **V1 Technical Design** written — links all decisions.
  ([docs/specs/v1-tech-design.md](./specs/v1-tech-design.md)).
- **10 GitHub issues created** (end-to-end build slices):
  [#17](https://github.com/jeremy-dardour/wedding-planner/issues/17)–[#26](https://github.com/jeremy-dardour/wedding-planner/issues/26).
- **Wayfinder map complete** — all 9 tickets resolved.

## Open questions

None.

## Next steps

Start building. First issue: **#17 — Entities + initial migration**.
